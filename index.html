          <b>RULES</b> To begin the game, click the "start" button. Each player will be dealt exactly half of the deck, with all cards being shuffled. Next, click the draw button and the player with the higher card value wins both sets of cards. In the instance of a tie...PREPARE FOR WAR!!!!! Each player will ante up an additional 3 cards to the pot, and then draw a 4th. The player with the higher card value wins the war and takes both sets of cards. Now repeat this process until either player is out of cards, enjoy!
