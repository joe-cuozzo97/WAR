WAR!
rules:
- To begin, click the start button
- The deck of cards will then be shuffled and split in half.
- Each player gets one half of the deck
- Press the draw button at the bottom, and 2 cards will be flipped to face off against eachother.
- The player with the higher card value in the face off wins the all of the cards on the board.
- In the event of a tie, 4 additional cards will be drawn for both players. The 4th cards from each players deck will be compared.
- The player with the higher card value wins the war and takes all cards that were in the pot!



Icebox:
I would like to have all of the war cards on screen so it can be a bit more engaging when there is a tie. Wars are the main point of the game so having those on screen would be a nice addition.I would also add a points function so if players wanted to quit the game before it finishes, we can see who was winning the game.
